<!-- In old days we used i to italicize things, however, along came screen readers to help people access the web. A screen reader will read the i-tag as if it's just another text, however, when a screen reader sees the em-tag, it knows to put verbal emphasis on that text, so the reader will hear the emphasis put on that text. -->

<!-- the i-tag is no longer used, if you need to emphasis text, use em-tag -->
