**Udemy Project 1 Task** 

**Describe**

This was a simple single page html and very minimal css website, to be done from memory as much as possible. 
Required:
* Nav w/ links
* A main section
    * Create a table
    * Create sections
        * link to read more
* An aside to the right
    * input for name and email
    * submit button
* Footer

Blogs: 
* Blog 1: include a video, using the video tag
* Blog 2: include an image, using the img self-closing tag

I added:
* Rather than an empty link for the blog sessions, I added links to each of the blogs pages, so the read more link takes you to that sessions page.
* an About Page, accessed via the nav bar
* a Contact Us Page, accessed via the nav bar
* Read Blog Preview Page
    * shows you the various blogs available to read, with a link to the individual blog post 
* Blog Post pages with home link to return to the Read Blog page
